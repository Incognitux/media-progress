# Progress Bar for the GNOME Media Notification
*This is a debug branch with a bunch of debug logs just for my convenience, not to be used.*

## Installation
I might upload to gnome-extensions when I'm ready with it, but for now heres the installation steps.

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
git clone https://github.com/Krypion17/media-progress && mv media-progress media-progress@krypion17
```
Then re-login and enable from the extension app, if not enabled.

## TODO
- Maybe a settings menu to disable timestamps.
